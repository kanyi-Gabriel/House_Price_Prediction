#  House Price Prediction & Analysis  

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview  
This project analyzes the **Kaggle House Prices dataset** to uncover the key determinants of housing prices and build predictive models.  

The workflow follows a **professional data science pipeline**:  
1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** â€“ Identify missing values, distributions, and correlations.  
2. **Feature Engineering** â€“ Create meaningful new variables (e.g., `TotalSF`, `HouseAge`, `TotalBath`).  
3. **Modeling** â€“ Train and evaluate models using cross-validation on log-transformed prices.  
4. **Hyperparameter Tuning** â€“ Optimize the best-performing model for accuracy.  
5. **Interpretation & Insights** â€“ Feature importance, partial dependence, and business insights.
